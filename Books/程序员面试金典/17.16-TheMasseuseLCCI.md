# 17.16. The Masseuse LCCI

## 题目

```
A popular masseuse receives a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests and is debating which ones to accept. 
She needs a break between appointments and therefore she cannot accept any adjacent requests. 
Given a sequence of back-to-back appoint­ ment requests, find the optimal (highest total booked minutes) set the masseuse can honor. 
Return the number of minutes.

Note: This problem is slightly different from the original one in the book.

Input:  [2,1,4,5,3,1,1,3]
Output:  12
Explanation:  Accept request 1, 3, 5 and 8, total minutes = 2 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 12

## 解法

- 借鉴思路 dp

```
## Time Complxity:O(n)    Space Complxity:O(n)
def massage_dp(self, nums: list) -> int:
	if not nums: 
		return 0
	if len(nums) == 1:
		return nums[0]
	dp = [0] * len(nums)
	dp[0], dp[1] = nums[0], max(nums[0], nums[1])
	for i in range(2, len(nums)):
		dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
	return dp[-1]
```

## Time Complxity:O(n)    Space Complxity:O(1)
def massage_con(self, nums: list) -> int:
	a, b = 0, 0
	for i in range(len(nums)):

		a = b
		b = c
	return b
